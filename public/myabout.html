    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I’m Aravindhan S, an aspiring Software Developer from Salem, currently pursuing a B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Sona College of Technology. My passion lies in Java programming, full-stack web development, and leveraging AI and data-driven technologies to build impactful solutions.<p>
    <p>I have gained hands-on experience through projects like Heat Watch (EPICS project), Smart Parking System, and AI-based Real-Time Traffic Management System. Additionally, I’ve interned in Artificial Intelligence at Infosys Springboard and won recognition in hackathons and circuit debugging competitions.</p>
    <p>My commitment to continuous learning has led me to earn certifications in Core Java, Frontend Full Stack Development, Spring Boot, and Design Thinking. Beyond academics, I’m an active member of the Sona Titans Club and have a knack for creative pursuits, such as playing the keyboard and art competitions.</p>
